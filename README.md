## 👋 About Me

Blockchain developer from Saint Paul, Minnesota, focused on building smart contracts and DeFi protocols. Currently deep in Solidity and Foundry, working on everything from escrow systems to liquidity pools.

When I'm not writing smart contracts, I'm building full-stack Web3 applications that bridge traditional web experiences with blockchain technology.

    string public education = "Metana Web3 Bootcamp Graduate";
    
    function getCurrentWork() public pure returns (string[] memory) {
        string[] memory projects = new string[](2);
        projects[0] = "ReWork - Resume tailoring platform";
        projects[1] = "Welp - Blockchain loyalty rewards platform";
        return projects;
    }
}
